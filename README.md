# Problem Statement
When someone needs to solve a problem, be it in science, engineering, or industry, they often spend considerable time trying to find the right tools. Often there are similar tools available, and it's not clear which tool is the best. This repository focuses on making this problem easy to solve. We deem that this implies:
1. **List**: There should be an organised list of tools and packages.
2. **Standard Benchmarks**: There should be standardised benchmarks so that we can assess tools on things like performance, accuracy, and robustness.
3. **Reviews**: There should be community sentiment to help finding the popular favourites within a problem class.

## Scope and Inclusion Criteria
By "tool" we mean any software, or software component, that solves a general enough problem that others would find it useful. The inclusion criteria to get on this list is broad but with some structure to keep things orderly.
1. The tool should solve a well-defined problem.
2. There should be a community of people who care about that problem.
3. The tool should already be exist in some repository.
4. Ideally, the tool should be actively maintained, but this need not be the case.
5. The tool should be JAX-based.

## Examples

These are some example of repos that would be on the list.

Name: Optimistix
- provides a JAX-library of gradient-based optimisers
- all sorts of communities care about gradient-based optimisation
- it's maintained on GitHub: [repo](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/optimistix)

Name: MPAX
- a JAX-based library for solving linear and quadratic programming
- linear and quadratic programming are highly useful to many fields
- it's maintained on GitHub: [repo](https://github.com/MIT-Lu-Lab/MPAX)

Name: JAXNS
- a nested sampling library for calculating Bayesian evidence
- many scientific fields like cosmology, partical physics, climate science, geo science, and economics care about Bayesian evience
- it's maintained on GitHub: [repo](https://github.com/Joshuaalbert/jaxns)
